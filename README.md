# Description 
This website will allow the user to enter a baseball player's name into the field along with the position that they play. Once the user submits their player, the player will show up in that specific position on an image of a baseball field. Ultimately, the user should be able to see a full starting lineup on the screen when they have submitted all positions for the players.
